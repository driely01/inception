## DOCKER
docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications in a consistent manner.

### virtual machines vs containers

- container
    an isolated environment for running an application
    - allow running multiple apps in isolation
    - are lightweight
    - use OS of the host
    - start quickly
    - need less hardware resources

- virtual machine
    an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware)
    **Problems**
    - each vm needs a full-blown OS
    - slow to start
    - resource intensive
